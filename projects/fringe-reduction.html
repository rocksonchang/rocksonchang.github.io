	<h1>Fringe reduction algorithm for absorption images</h1>
	<p align="justify">
	In the study of ultracold atoms, we often take images of the atom cloud.  From these images we can infer many things regarding the state of the atoms, and as such, the quality of these images is of utmost importance.  The most common type of noise which degrades image quality is due to a mismatch between an absorption image and a background reference image which creates a residual fringe structure. In this post, I present an implementation of a fringe reduction algorithm for absorption images of ultracold atoms.

	<p align="justify">
	In a nutshell, the algorithm takes in a series of reference images, essentially containing only the noise.  The algorithm then decomposes the noise present in these images into an orthonormal basis through Schmidt-Decomposition.  With this basis, an idealized reference image can be constructred to cancel out the noise in the images with the atoms (the signal).  In practice only a small number of basis vectors is sufficient to dramatically improve image quality, as seen below.  The key reason why this approach works is that there is an inherent structure in the noise which significantly reduces the space of possible noise vectors.

In general, images contain the atoms (horizontally oriented, pancake shaped cloud) and noise (circular, high spatial frequency fringes).  Implementing the algorithm with as few as eight noise basis images significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio.  </figcaption>
