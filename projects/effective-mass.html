	<b>Transport</b> -- the study of how objects, from cars, people, organic cells, to electrons, get from point A to B -- is one of the most fascinating topics in modern science.  For example, the study of traffic patterns is highly complex, involving variables as diverse as road conditions, road layouts and driver tendencies.  Anyone who has ever driven can attest to the fact that driving in the city is completely different from driving in the suburbs.

	The transport of electrons in a medium, an inherently quantum mechanical process, is equally fascinating.  On a microscopic level, transport depends on the interactions between the electrons and the medium itself, which pushes and pulls on the electron modifying its motion.

	<p align="justify">
    One of the miraculous results of quantum theory is that the details of these interactions average themselves out to recover the classical equations of motion,  <span lang="latex">Force\,\,=\,\,mass \,\, \times \,\, acceleration</span>, but with an <i>effective</i> mass, <span lang="latex">m^\star</span>.  In other words, all the pushing and pulling of the medium on the electron can be absorbed into the effective mass.  In semiconductor materials, the effective mass can be dramatically different.  For example the effective mass of an electron in Silicon is five times smaller than outside of the medium.  The low effective mass implies a large conductivity and is one of the reasons why Silicon is the basis of modern electronics.

	<p align="justify">
	In 1954, it was predicted that there is in fact a lag in the interaction between the particle and the medium. At the University of Toronto, we used a system of ultracold atoms, confined in an optical lattice, as a model system for electrons in a semiconductor.  We studied how these atoms responded to an external force.  What we found was that the particle <i>initially</i> responds as if it was moving in a vacuum (with mass, <span lang="latex">m</span>).

	<p align="justify">
	Over time, the medium catches up to the particle and begins to extert an opposing force, modify its motion and resulting in the effective mass, <i>m*</i>.  We were thus able to observe a smooth transition from the free-particle regime of transport, to the transport in a medium.  Just like the runner to the left trying to run on water, at first the atoms may move freely, but eventually the medium wins out slowing them down.

	<div style="clear:both;"></div>
	<p align="justify">
	From a conceptual standpoint, this is a very satisfying result, as it allows us to connect two distinct regimes of transport, thus verifying predictions made over 60 years ago.  The use of ultracold atoms is fundamental to this study, allowing us to create a <i>simulator</i> of real materials for which the microscopic physics can often be difficult to directly access.
