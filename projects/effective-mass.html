	<b>Transport</b>, the study of how objects -- cars, people, organic cells, electrons etc. -- get from point A to B, is one of the most fascinating topics in modern science.  For example, the study of traffic patterns is highly complex, involving variables as varied as road conditions, road layouts and driver tendencies.  Clearly, driving in the city is completely different from driving in the suburbs.

	The transport of electrons in a medium, an inherently quantum mechanical process, is equally fascinating.  On a microscopic level, transport depends on the interactions between the electrons and the medium itself, which pushes and pulls on the electron modifying its motion.

	<p align="justify">
    One of the miraculous results of quantum theory is that the details of these interactions average themselves out to recover the classical equations of motion, <i>Force = mass x acceleration</i>, but with an <i>effective</i> mass, <i>m*</i>.  In other words, all the pushing and pulling of the medium on the electron can be absorbed into the effective mass.  In semiconductor materials, the effective mass can be dramatically different (for example Silicon has a very small effective mass <i>m*=0.2m</i>, and is one of the reasons why Silicon is the basis of modern electronics).

	In 1954, Pfirsch and Spenke predicted that there is in fact a lag in the interaction between the particle and the medium. At the University of Toronto, we used system of ultracold atoms, confined in a one-dimensional optical lattice, as a model system for electrons in a semiconductor.  We studied how these atoms responded to an external force.

	<p align="justify">
	What we found was that the particle <i>initially</i> responds as if it was moving in a vacuum (with mass, <i>m</i>).  Over time, the medium catches up to the particle and begins to modify its motion resulting in the effective mass, <i>m*</i>.  Just like the runner to the left trying to run on water, at first the atoms move freely, but eventually the medium wins out.

	Our work was the first demonstration of this phenomenon, linking two different regimes of transport. The use of ultracold atoms to realize this study is fundamental, as it allows us to construct <i>simulators</i> of real materials, for which the the microscopic physics can be difficult to directly access.
