	<h1>An image processing GUI for ultracold atoms</h1>
	<p align="justify">
		In the experimental study of ultracold atoms, 95% of the data is collected through images of the atom cloud.  Information regarding the number of atoms present, their spatial distribution, their velocity distribution, internal spin state, etc. can all be inferred from these images.

		At the <a href="https://www.lcf.institutoptique.fr/Groupes-de-recherche/Optique-atomique/Experiences/Lattice-Gases">Institut d'Optique</a>, I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for the analysis of such images ultracold clouds of metastable Helium.  This interface performed some image treatment, least-squares fitting of the 2D cloud distributions and basic analysis of a sequence of images.  Different modes of image treatment are available, depending on the type of imaging performed (absorption or fluoresence).

		This GUI was developed in Matlab 2011a using GUIDE.  Check out the project files on <a href="https://github.com/rocksonchang/Helium-IP">Github</a>.
