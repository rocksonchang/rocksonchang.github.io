	<h1>An image processing GUI for ultracold atoms</h1>
	<p align="justify">
		In the experimental study of ultracold atoms, 95% of data comes in the form of 2D images of the atom cloud.  Information regarding the number of atoms present, their spatial distribution, their velocity distribution, internal spin state, etc. can all be inferred from these images.

		At the <a href="https://www.lcf.institutoptique.fr/Groupes-de-recherche/Optique-atomique/Experiences/Lattice-Gases">Institut d'Optique</a>, I have been developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the analysis of images of ultracold clouds of metastable Helium.  This interface is multi-functional, for example performing image treatment, least-squares fitting of the 2D cloud distributions and basic analysis of a sequence of images.  Different modes of image treatment are available, depending on the type of imaging performed (absorption or fluoresence imaging).
