		Particles and waves behave inherently differently.  In the everyday world, this distinction is clear: particles (think: <i>marbles</i>) travel in straight lines
		on well defined trajectories, waves (think: <i>water</i>) spread out moving in all directions, going around corners and even through walls.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		In the microscopic world, this distinction is less clear.  Particles can sometimes behave like waves, and waves can sometimes behave like particles.
		At the University of Toronto, we cooled a cloud of atoms down to near absolute zero temperature.  As we cool, we cross the threhold from the
		everyday <i>classical</i> world, to the microscopic <i>quantum</i> world.  With these atoms we can explore this wave-particle duality and observe
		matter-wave interference effects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Such interferences are in fact prominent during the collision of a quantum particle with a barrier.  In our experiments we can freeze out the
		dynamics during a collision and directly probe these rich interference structures which reveals key information on the interactions between 
		the particle and the target.
