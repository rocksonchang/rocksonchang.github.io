<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"> Jekyll</a> powered, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> hosted, website is live.  It's looking pretty decent for half a day's work.  Over the next few days I'll be filling it in with some of my past projects, vulgarized for public consumption.  In the future, maybe I'll add some more personal things such as my drawings of naked people and some climbing projects.
